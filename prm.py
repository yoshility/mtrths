On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.

      "On Saturday, they take back one third of the flamingos. Since there were 18 flamingos, (1/3 \\times 18 = 6) flamingos are taken back. So, they have (18 - 6 = 12) flamingos left in their possession. Then, they paint these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. Now, Sue has the original 12 pink flamingos plus the 6 new white ones. Thus, by the end of Saturday, Sue has (12 + 6 = 18) pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.",
